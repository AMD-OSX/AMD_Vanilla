Binary kernel patches to enable almost native AMD CPU support on macOS.

  

# Read me first!

Patches are now universal across 15h, 16h, 17h, and 19h by utilizing the OpenCore kernel Quirk `ProvideCurrentCpuInfo`. OpenCore 0.7.1 or newer is required.

Make sure to ****enable**** this quirk or the system ****won't boot****.

**Note for Zen 4:** Zen 4 (Ryzen 7000) requires patching for IOPCIFamily.kext <br />
This patches is enabled by default. Please ensure that you've got it added to your current config for Zen 4 stability. 
This patch also fixes the problem on MSI A520, B550 and X570 motherboards.

Core Count patch needs to be modified to boot your system. Find the three `algrey - Force cpuid_cores_per_package` patches and alter the `Replace` value only.

Change `B8000000 0000`/`BA000000 0000`/`BA000000 0090`* to `B8 <Core Count> 0000 0000`/`BA <Core Count> 0000 0000`/`BA <Core Count> 0000 0090`*, substituting `<Core Count>` with the hexadecimal value matching your physical core count. Do not use your CPU's thread count.

**Note:** *The three different values reflect the patch for different versions of macOS. Be sure to change all three if you boot macOS 10.13 to macOS 12*

See the table below for the values matching your CPU core count.

| Core Count | Hexadecimal |
|------------|-------------|
|   4 Core   |     `04`    |
|   6 Core   |     `06`    |
|   8 Core   |     `08`    |
|   12 Core  |     `0C`    |
|   16 Core  |     `10`    |
|   24 Core  |     `18`    |
|   32 Core  |     `20`    |

So for example, a user with a 6-core processor should use these `Replace` values: `B8 06 0000 0000`/`BA 06 0000 0000`/`BA 06 0000 0090`

## Features

- Enables macOS to run on AMD CPUs on the fly.

- Enables iMessage, Siri, FaceTime, Continuity, etc.

- Stable compared to custom XNU kernel.

## Disadvantages

- No 32-bit support (OPEMU) in 10.14 and lower

## Supported AMD CPUs

|     Family    |  Codename |              Example              |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
|      15h      | Bulldozer |             FX Series             |
|      16h      |   Jaguar  | A Series (including AM4 A-Series) |
|  17h and 19h  |    Zen    | Ryzen, Threadripper, Athlon 2xxGE |<br />

## Information on the fix PAT patch

The default enabled patch is Algrey's original patch. This will work for all GPUs and doesn't affect audio but doesn't improve performance.

The other choice is Shaneee's patch which will increase GPU performance on AMD GPUs but can stop NVIDIA GPUs from booting. It might also causes audio issues when using HDMI or DisplayPort audio.

The choice is yours. Don't try to use them both at the same time.

## Note on TRX40 systems

Both `mtrr_update_action - fix PAT` patches are not required on TRX40 systems. Disabling them will result in GPU performance improvements. Test this configuration on a USB drive first in preparation for the unlikely event that something goes wrong. Proceed at your own risk.

## Supported macOS versions

- macOS High Sierra (10.13)

- macOS Mojave (10.14)

- macOS Catalina (10.15)

- macOS Big Sur (11)

- macOS Monterey (12)

- macOS Ventura (13)

## Instructions

Follow the [Dortania OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) for instructions on how to create the installer USB and setup the config file with these patches.

Do not ask for support on GitHub.

## Special notes

- Use the latest release of OpenCore to avoid incompatibilities. Find the latest release [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases/latest).

- For support creating OpenCore config read the docs and visit [this](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) guide or the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EfCYAJW).

- For 15h_16h CPU family users on macOS Mojave:

- Upon booting to macOS Mojave for first time, the system will reboot after the Data & Privacy screen. To fix this issue follow the procedure mentioned [here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335877-amd-mojave-kernel-development-and-testing/?do=findComment&comment=2658085) under UPDATE-2 heading.

- On macOS Mojave, certain webpages will crash upon loading (eg. brew.sh, facebook.com). To fix this issue follow the procedure mentioned [here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335877-amd-mojave-kernel-development-and-testing/?do=findComment&comment=2661857) under the UPDATE-5 heading.
