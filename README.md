# AMD Vanilla OpenCore

</span>


### Patches for beta versions are provided, but no support is given until the OS is released.
### Try these patches at your own risk, and always keep an EFI backup.

### Languages: English (current)

Binary kernel patches to enable almost native AMD CPU support on macOS.

# Read me first!

Patches are now universal across 15h, 16h, 17h, and 19h by utilizing the OpenCore kernel Quirk `ProvideCurrentCpuInfo`. [OpenCore](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases) 0.7.1 or newer is required.
Make sure to **enable** this quirk or the system **won't boot**.


###Note for Zen 4:

Zen 4 (Ryzen 7000) requires patching for IOPCIFamily.kext. <br/>
This patch is enabled by default. Please ensure that you've added it to your current config for Zen 4 stability. 
This patch also allows MSI A520, B550, and X570 boards to boot macOS Monterey and newer.

The Core Count patch needs to be modified to boot your system. Find the four `algrey - Force cpuid_cores_per_package` patches and alter the `Replace` value only.

|   macOS Version      | Replace Value | New Value |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 10.13.x, 10.14.x     | B8000000 0000 | B8 < Core Count > 0000 0000 |
| 10.15.x, 11.x        | BA000000 0000 | BA < Core Count > 0000 0000 |
| 12.x, 13.0 to 13.2.1 | BA000000 0090 | BA < Core Count > 0000 0090 |
| 13.3 +               |  BA000000 00  | BA < Core Count > 0000 00 |

From the table above substitue `< Core Count >` with the hexadecimal value matching your physical core count. Do not use your CPU's thread count. See the table below for the values matching your CPU core count.


| Core Count | Hexadecimal |
|------------|-------------|
|   4 Core   |     `04`    |
|   6 Core   |     `06`    |
|   8 Core   |     `08`    |
|   12 Core  |     `0C`    |
|   16 Core  |     `10`    |
|   24 Core  |     `18`    |
|   32 Core  |     `20`    |

So for example, a user with a 6-core processor should use these `Replace` values: `B8 06 0000 0000` / `BA 06 0000 0000` / `BA 06 0000 0090` / `BA 06 0000 00`

## Features

- Enables macOS to run on AMD CPUs on the fly.

- Enables iMessage, Siri, FaceTime, Continuity, etc.

- Stable compared to custom XNU kernel.

## Disadvantages

- No 32-bit support (OPEMU) in 10.14 and lower

## Supported AMD CPUs

|     Family    |  Codename |              Example              |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
|      15h      | Bulldozer |             FX Series             |
|      16h      |   Jaguar  | A Series (including AM4 A-Series) |
|  17h and 19h  |    Zen    | Ryzen, Threadripper, Athlon 2xxGE |<br />

## Information on the fix PAT patch

The default enabled patch is Algrey's original patch. This will work for all GPUs and doesn't affect audio but doesn't improve performance.

The other choice is Shaneee's patch which will increase GPU performance on AMD GPUs but can stop NVIDIA GPUs from booting. It might also causes audio issues when using HDMI or DisplayPort audio.

`Note:` There are two versions of these patches. macOS Sequoia has it's own PAT patch. 

The choice is yours. Don't try to use them both at the same time.

## Note on TRX40 systems

Both `mtrr_update_action - fix PAT` patches are not required on TRX40 systems. Disabling them will result in GPU performance improvements. Test this configuration on a USB drive first in preparation for the unlikely event that something goes wrong. Proceed at your own risk.

## Information on the Fix PCI bus enumeration patch

On AM5 motherboards with on-board Thunderbolt/USB4 (e.g. Asus ROG Crosshair X670E Hero, Gene, Extreme; Asus ProArt X670E-Creator), macOS Ventura may not enumerate devices on the PCI bus properly when on-board WiFi and on-board Thunderbolt are both enabled. This patch bypasses the problem. This patch is disabled by default.

## Supported macOS versions

- macOS High Sierra (10.13)

- macOS Mojave (10.14)

- macOS Catalina (10.15)

- macOS Big Sur (11)

- macOS Monterey (12)

- macOS Ventura (13)

- macOS Sonoma (14)

- macOS Sequoia (15)

## Instructions

Follow the [Dortania OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) for instructions on how to create the installer USB and set up the config file with these patches.

Do not ask for support on GitHub.

## Special notes

- Use the latest release of OpenCore to avoid incompatibilities. Find the latest release [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases/latest).

- For support creating OpenCore config read the docs and visit [this](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) guide or the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EfCYAJW).

- For 15h_16h CPU family users on macOS Mojave:

- Upon booting to macOS Mojave for first time, the system will reboot after the Data & Privacy screen. To fix this issue follow the procedure mentioned [here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335877-amd-mojave-kernel-development-and-testing/?do=findComment&comment=2658085) under UPDATE-2 heading.

- On macOS Mojave, certain webpages will crash upon loading (eg. brew.sh, facebook.com). To fix this issue follow the procedure mentioned [here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335877-amd-mojave-kernel-development-and-testing/?do=findComment&comment=2661857) under the UPDATE-5 heading.
