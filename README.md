### Languages: English (current)

  

Binary Kernel patches to enable almost native AMD CPU support on macOS.

  

# Read Me First!

Patches are now universal across 15h, 16h, 17h and 19h by utilizing the OpenCore Kernel Quirk `ProvideCurrentCpuInfo`. OpenCore 0.7.1 or newer is required.

Make sure to ****enable**** this quirk or the system ****won't boot****.

This quirk provides the kernel with the CPU frequencies for macOS to boot.

  

Core Count patch needs to be modified to boot your system. Find the three `algrey - Force cpuid_cores_per_package` patches and alter the `Replace` value only.

Changing `B8000000 0000`/`BA000000 0000`/`BA000000 0090`* to `B8 <CoreCount> 0000 0000`/`BA <CoreCount> 0000 0000`/`BA <CoreCount> 0000 0090`* substituting `<CoreCount>` with the hexadecimal value matching your physical core count.

**Note:** *The three different values reflect the patch for different versions of macOS. Be sure to change all three if you boot macOS 10.13 to macOS 12*

See the table below for the values matching your CPU Core Count.

| CoreCount | Hexadecimal|
|--------|---------|
|   4 Core  | `04` |
|   6 Core  | `06` |
|   8 Core  | `08` |
|   12 Core | `0C` |
|   16 Core | `10` |
|   24 Core | `18` |
|   32 Core | `20` |

  So for example a 6 Core 5600X Replace value would result in these replace values, `B8 06 0000 0000`/`BA 06 0000 0000`/`BA 06 0000 0090`

## Features

- Enables macOS to run on AMD CPUs on the fly.

- Enables iMessage, Siri, FaceTime, Continuity etc.

- Stable compared to custom XNU kernel.

  

## Disadvantages

- No 32-bit support (OPEMU) in 10.14 and lower

  

## Supported AMD CPU's


| Family | Codename| Example |
|--------|---------|----------|
|   15h  | Bulldozer | FX Series|
|   16h  | Jaguar | A Series (including AM4 A-Series) |
|   17h and 19h | Zen | Ryzen, 1st, 2nd + 3rd Gen Threadripper, Athlon 2xxGE |<br />

  

## Information on the PAT fix patch

The default enabled patch is Algrey's original patch. This will work for all GPUs and doesn't affect audio but doesn't improve the performance.

The other choice is Shaneee's patch which will increase GPU performance on AMD GPUs but can stop Nvidia GPUs booting. It also causes audio issues when using HDMI and DP audio.

The choice is yours on which patch to use. Please don't try to use them both at the same time.

  

## Note on TRX40 Systems

`mtrr_update_action - fix PAT` patch is not required for TRX40 systems. Disabling it will result in GPU performance improvements. Test this configuration on a USB drive first in preparation for the unlikely event that something goes wrong. Proceed at your own risk.

## Supported macOS versions

- High Sierra 10.13.x

- Mojave 10.14.x

- Catalina 10.15.x

- Big Sur 11.x

- Monterey 12.x

- Ventura 13.x ( Patches provided but **No*** support for beta versions. )

  

## Instructions

Follow the [Dortania OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) for instructions on how to create the installer USB and setup the config file with these patches.


## Special Notes

- Use the latest Release of OpenCore to avoid incompatibilities. Find the latest release [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases/latest).

- For support creating OpenCore config read the docs and visit [this](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) guide or the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/EfCYAJW).

- For 15h_16h CPU family users on macOS Mojave:

- Upon booting to macOS Mojave for first time, the system will reboot after the Data & Privacy screen. To fix this issue follow the procedure mentioned [here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335877-amd-mojave-kernel-development-and-testing/?do=findComment&comment=2658085) under UPDATE-2 heading.

- On macOS Mojave certain webpages will crash upon loading (eg. brew.sh, facebook.com). To fix this issue follow the procedure mentioned [here](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/topic/335877-amd-mojave-kernel-development-and-testing/?do=findComment&comment=2661857) under the UPDATE-5 heading.
